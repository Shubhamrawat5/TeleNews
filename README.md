Now the main 2 steps!

`1) Get a bot token`

You would need to create a telegram bot now by [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather)

Send /newbot message to BotFather telegram bot and create a bot then it would give you a bot token api, copy this token

Token looks like : XXXXXXXX:YYYYYYY-YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY_YY

`2) Get chat id or chat tag`

Now there are two different places to send news!

Do only one from 2.1 or 2.2 (any one, read heading of both)

`2.1) You want to send Tech News to a group or channel`

Create a channel/group (if you don't have) then add your bot to your group, to add your bot , you would need the username of bot that you gave to BotFather

Now create a link of your group by making group public then It'll ask to write a group unique link and then copy this group link and remove t.me/ and add @

Eg: Group link t.me/pvxtechnews tag is @pvxtechnews

[Note: You can use group id also, if you group/channel is private]

Now move to 9th step!

`2.2) You want to send Tech News to your telegram account`

Send a message to [Get your telegram id](http://t.me/get_user_id_bot)

Save your telegram id

[Important Note: You need to send a message to your bot because Bot can't start a conversation first so you would need to send a message to your bot (This is a restrictions by telegram to avoid spams by bots)]

<hr>

9) Now you have token and your_id or group_tag , Execute Data file
```
$ python Data.py
```
Now enter 1 and then enter token then enter your_id or group_tag or group_id

Now after saving send 0 to exit from the file

10) Finally last step to post some awesome tech news!!!
```
python Technews.py
```

Now it'll ask you to choose a source then ask for confirmation then send :)

[Note: if you've followed all the instructions correctly then tech news will surely be posted! Otherwise check after 8th step and read everything carefully]


`Now whenever you want to post tech news direct do 10th step only!`

`If you want to change bot or group then do 9th step`
